Processed data

This folder contains processed and derived datasets generated by the Bührig Metrics Reproducible Pipeline during its sequential execution. All files stored here are the result of deterministic transformations applied to the raw input data and constitute the operational geometric basis for metric computation and validation.

The contents of this directory are pipeline outputs, not original observations. They can be regenerated from the raw data by executing the pipeline stages in the prescribed order. Files in this folder should not be manually edited, as doing so would break reproducibility and traceability.

Contents overview

The processed datasets include:

Reprojected bathymetric DEM
SAC_GMRT_DEM_UTM18S.tif
Submarine digital elevation model derived from GMRT and reprojected to a metric coordinate system (UTM 18S). This raster provides the continuous depth surface used for profile extraction and geometric reconstruction.

Thalweg sampling points
thalweg_points_2km.*
Regularly spaced points generated every 2 km along the canyon thalweg. These points define the longitudinal positions of transversal profiles.

Transversal profiles
SAC_transversal_profiles.*
and
SAC_transversal_profiles_Clean.*
Vector datasets representing transversal profiles constructed locally perpendicular to the canyon thalweg. The “Clean” version corresponds to geometrically validated profiles used for metric computation.

Geometric key points (P1–P4)
SAC_profile_keypoints_P1_P2_3.*
SAC_profile_keypoints_P4.*
SAC_profile_keypoints_P1_P2_P3_P4.*
Vector and tabular datasets containing the geometric key points defined on each transversal profile. These datasets represent the formal geometric construction underlying Wmax, Dmax, and SWmax computation.

Computed metrics
SAC_Buhring_metrics_all_profiles.csv
Tabular dataset containing the final Bührig-type metrics and auxiliary geometric quantities computed for all profiles.

File formats

Processed datasets are stored using standard geospatial formats:

GeoTIFF for raster data.

ESRI Shapefile (with associated .shp, .dbf, .shx, .prj, .cpg files) for vector data.

CSV for tabular outputs.

These formats ensure interoperability with common GIS and scientific computing environments.

Reproducibility and data policy

All datasets in this folder are fully reproducible from the raw input data using the pipeline scripts provided in the src/ directory. This folder may be safely deleted and regenerated if required.

The processed data are included here for documentation, validation, and citation purposes. Their presence does not imply unrestricted reuse or redistribution.

Relation to the methodological manual

The geometric meaning, construction rules, and methodological role of all datasets stored in this folder are formally defined in the manual:

Manual para la implementación geométrica y computacional reproducible de métricas tipo Bührig en cañones submarinos

This manual constitutes the authoritative reference for interpreting the processed datasets and their role within the pipeline.
