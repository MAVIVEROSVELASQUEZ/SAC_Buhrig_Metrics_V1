Raw input data

This folder contains the original, unmodified input datasets used by the Bührig Metrics Reproducible Pipeline. All files stored here are considered reference data and constitute the primary geometric inputs for the pipeline. These datasets must remain immutable to preserve reproducibility and traceability.

No processing, editing, or manual correction should be applied directly to the files contained in this directory.

Contents overview

The raw datasets include:

Submarine Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
GMRT_raster/GMRTv4_4_0_20260119topo-mask.tif
Bathymetric raster derived from the Global Multi-Resolution Topography (GMRT) synthesis. The dataset is provided in geographic coordinates (WGS84) and represents the original depth surface prior to any reprojection or resampling. This file constitutes the sole raster input to the pipeline.

Canyon edge polylines
SAC_Edge.*
Vector dataset defining the left and right edges of the submarine canyon. These geometries represent interpreted geomorphological boundaries and are used to identify canyon margins in each transversal profile.

Canyon thalweg polyline
SAC_Thalweg.*
Vector dataset representing the main canyon thalweg. This geometry defines the longitudinal reference axis of the system and is used for profile positioning and local orientation.

All vector datasets are provided as ESRI Shapefiles, including the associated .shp, .dbf, .shx, .prj, .sbn, .sbx, and .cpg files.

Data provenance

The bathymetric DEM is sourced from GMRT (Global Multi-Resolution Topography), which integrates multibeam and single-beam bathymetric data at regional to global scales. The vector layers (thalweg and canyon edges) were produced through prior geomorphological interpretation and validation and are treated as fixed structural references within the pipeline.

Reproducibility policy

All subsequent datasets generated by the pipeline are derived exclusively from the contents of this folder. Any modification to these raw files will invalidate the reproducibility of the results.

If regeneration of processed or intermediate data is required, this folder should remain unchanged and the pipeline should be re-executed from the initial stage.

Relation to processed data and methodology

The transformation of these raw datasets into processed geometries, key points, and morphometric metrics is fully documented in the methodological manual:

Manual para la implementación geométrica y computacional reproducible de métricas tipo Bührig en cañones submarinos

This manual provides the formal geometric definitions and assumptions required to interpret both raw and processed datasets.
