Pipeline stages

Stage 01 – DEM preparation
The original submarine digital elevation model is reprojected to a metric coordinate system (UTM). This step establishes a common spatial reference for the entire pipeline and ensures dimensional consistency in distance, slope, and angle calculations.

Stage 02 – Thalweg discretization
The canyon axis is discretized by generating regularly spaced points along the thalweg at a predefined interval. These points define the longitudinal locations of the transverse profiles.

Stage 03 – Transverse profile generation
At each discretized thalweg point, transverse profiles are constructed with a locally defined orientation perpendicular to the canyon axis. Orientation is derived from the local geometry of the thalweg, avoiding assumptions of global alignment.

Stage 04 – Extraction of observable geometric points (P1–P3)
For each transverse profile, the observable geometric points are identified: the thalweg (P1) and the left and right canyon edges (P2 and P3), defined by the intersection between the profile and the canyon edge polylines.

Stage 05 – Construction of the auxiliary geometric point (P4)
The auxiliary point P4 is constructed as the intersection between the vertical line passing through the thalweg and the horizontal line defining the maximum canyon width. This point is not directly observed but is defined geometrically to ensure consistency between Wmax and Dmax.

Stage 06 – Integration of geometric points (P1–P4)
The geometric points defined in previous stages are integrated into a single dataset for each profile, ensuring consistent attributes, geometric ordering, and traceability.

Stage 07 – Computation of Bührig-type metrics
Using the complete profile geometry, the metrics Wmax, Dmax, and SWmax are computed, together with auxiliary geometric quantities required for profile decomposition. Calculations are performed without assuming symmetry or ideal orthogonality.

Stage 08 – Individual geomorphological validation
Selected transverse profiles are fully reconstructed from the DEM and visualized together with all defined geometric elements. This stage enables detailed inspection of geometric coherence at the profile level.

Stage 09 – Global geomorphological validation
Systematic visualizations are generated for all transverse profiles, allowing assessment of metric stability, identification of potential local anomalies, and verification of the pipeline’s global consistency.

Dependencies and execution

Each pipeline stage depends strictly on the outputs generated by the preceding stage. Executing stages out of sequence or manually modifying intermediate results compromises reproducibility.

The pipeline is designed to be executed sequentially, either by running the numbered scripts individually or through an orchestration script when access and execution are enabled.

Relation to the methodological manual

This document describes only the operational workflow of the pipeline. The complete conceptual, geometric, and methodological definitions underlying each stage are documented in the independent manual:

Manual for the reproducible geometric and computational implementation of Bührig-type metrics in submarine canyons

This manual constitutes the authoritative reference for interpretation of the workflow and all derived results.
